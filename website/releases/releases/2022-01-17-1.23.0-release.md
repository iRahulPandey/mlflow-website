We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.23.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.23.0)!

MLflow 1.23.0 includes several major features and improvements:

Features:

- [Models] Introduce an `mlflow.evaluate()` API for evaluating MLflow Models, providing performance and explainability insights. For an overview, see https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-evaluation ([#5069](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5069), [#5092](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5092), [#5256](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5256), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))
- [Models] `log_model()` APIs now return information about the logged MLflow Model, including artifact location, flavors, and schema ([#5230](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5230), [@liangz1](https://github.com/liangz1))
- [Models] Introduce an `mlflow.models.Model.load_input_example()` Python API for loading MLflow Model input examples ([#5212](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5212), [@maitre-matt](https://github.com/maitre-matt))
- [Models] Add a UUID field to the MLflow Model specification. MLflow Models now have a unique identifier ([#5149](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5149), [#5167](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5167), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))

- [Model Registry] Support specifying `latest` in model URI to get the latest version of a model regardless of the stage ([#5027](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5027), [@lichenran1234](https://github.com/lichenran1234))
- [Tracking] Add support for LightGBM scikit-learn models to `mlflow.lightgbm.autolog()` ([#5130](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5130), [#5200](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5200), [#5271](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5271) [@jwyyy](https://github.com/jwyyy))
- [Tracking] Improve S3 artifact download speed by caching boto clients ([#4695](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4695), [@Samreay](https://github.com/Samreay))
