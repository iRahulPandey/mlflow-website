MLflow 2.10.1 is a patch release, containing fixes for various bugs in the `transformers` and `langchain` flavors, the MLflow UI, and the S3 artifact store. More details can be found in the patch notes below.

Bug fixes:

- [UI] Fixed a bug that prevented datasets from showing up in the MLflow UI ([#10992](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10992), [@daniellok-db](https://github.com/daniellok-db))
- [Artifact Store] Fixed directory bucket region name retrieval ([#10967](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10967), [@kriscon-db](https://github.com/kriscon-db))
- Bug fixes for Transformers flavor
  - [Models] Fix an issue with transformer pipelines not inheriting the torch dtype specified on the model, causing pipeline inference to consume more resources than expected. ([#10979](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10979), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))
  - [Models] Fix non-idempotent prediction due to in-place update to model-config ([#11014](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11014), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

Previously, calling `predict()` on a pyfunc-loaded Text2TextGeneration pipeline would fail for `string` and `List[string]` inputs. ([#10960](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10960), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))
