We are excited to announce the release of MLflow 2.16.0. This release includes many major features and improvements!

### Major features:

- **LlamaIndex Enhancements**ðŸ¦™ - to provide additional flexibility to the [LlamaIndex integration](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llama-index/index.html), we now have support for the [models-from-code](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#models-from-code) functionality for logging, extended engine-based logging, and broadened support for external vector stores.

- **LangGraph Support** - We've expanded the LangChain integration to support the agent framework [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/). With tracing and support for logging using the models-from-code feature, creating and storing agent applications has never been easier!

- **AutoGen Tracing** - Full automatic support for tracing multi-turn agent applications built with [Microsoft's AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) framework is now available in MLflow. Enabling autologging via `mlflow.autogen.autolog()` will instrument your agents built with AutoGen.

- **Plugin support for AI Gateway** - You can now define your own provider interfaces that will work with MLflow's AI Gateway (also known as the MLflow Deployments Server). Creating an installable provider definition will allow you to connect the Gateway server to any GenAI service of your choosing.
