We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.9.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.9.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.9.0 includes the following major features and improvements:

- `log_model` and `save_model` APIs now support saving model signatures (the model's input and output schema)
  and example input along with the model itself ([#2698](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2698), [#2775](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2775), [@tomasatdatabricks](https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks)). Model signatures are used
  to reorder and validate input fields when scoring/serving models using the pyfunc flavor, `mlflow models`
  CLI commands, or `mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf` ([#2920](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2920), [@tomasatdatabricks](https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks) and [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav))
- Introduce fastai model persistence and autologging APIs under `mlflow.fastai` ([#2619](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2619), [#2689](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2689) [@antoniomdk](https://github.com/antoniomdk))
- Add pluggable `mlflow.deployments` API and CLI for deploying models to custom serving tools, e.g. RedisAI
  ([#2327](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2327), [@hhsecond](https://github.com/hhsecond))
- Add plugin interface for executing MLflow projects against custom backends ([#2566](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2566), [@jdlesage](https://github.com/jdlesage))
- Enable viewing PDFs logged as artifacts from the runs UI ([#2859](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2859), [@ankmathur96](https://github.com/ankmathur96))
- Significant performance and scalability improvements to metric comparison and scatter plots in
  the UI ([#2447](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2447), [@mjlbach](https://github.com/mjlbach))
