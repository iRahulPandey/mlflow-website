We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 2.0.1](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v2.0.1)!

The 2.0.1 version of MLflow is a major milestone release that focuses on simplifying the management of end-to-end MLOps workflows, providing new feature-rich functionality, and expanding upon the production-ready MLOps capabilities offered by MLflow. Check out the [MLflow 2.0 blog post](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/announcing-availability-of-mlflow-2.0)
for an in-depth walk through!
