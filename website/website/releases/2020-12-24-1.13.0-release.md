- Add `mlflow.log_image` which logs an image object as an artifact ([#3728](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3728), [@harupy](https://github.com/harupy))

### UI updates / fixes:

- Add model version link in compact experiment table view
- Add logged/registered model links in experiment runs page view
- Enhance artifact viewer for MLflow models
- Model registry UI settings are now persisted across browser sessions
