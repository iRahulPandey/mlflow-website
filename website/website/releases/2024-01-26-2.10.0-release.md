MLflow 2.10.0 includes several major features and improvements!

In MLflow 2.10, we're introducing a number of significant new features that are preparing the way for current and future enhanced support for Deep Learning use cases, new features to support a broadened support for GenAI applications, and some quality of life improvements for the MLflow Deployments Server (formerly the AI Gateway).

### New MLflow Website

We have a new [home](https://mlflow.org). The new site landing page is fresh, modern, and contains more content than ever. We're adding new content and blogs all of the time.

### Model Signature Supports Objects and Arrays ([#9936](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/9936), [@serena-ruan](https://github.com/serena-ruan))

Objects and Arrays are now available as configurable input and output schema elements. These new types are particularly useful for GenAI-focused flavors that can have complex input and output types. See the new [Signature and Input Example documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model/signatures.html) to learn more about how to use these new signature types.

### Langchain Autologging ([#10801](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10801), [@serena-ruan](https://github.com/serena-ruan))

LangChain has autologging support now! When you invoke a chain, with autologging enabled, we will automatically log most chain implementations, recording and storing your configured LLM application for you. See the new [Langchain documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/langchain/index.html#mlflow-langchain-autologging) to learn more about how to use this feature.

### Prompt Templating for Transformers Models

The MLflow `transformers` flavor now supports prompt templates. You can now specify an application-specific set of instructions to submit to your GenAI pipeline in order to simplify, streamline, and integrate sets of system prompts to be supplied with each input request. Check out the updated [guide to transformers](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/index.html) to learn more and see examples!

### MLflow Deployments Server Enhancement

The MLflow Deployments Server now supports two new requested features: (1) OpenAI endpoints that support streaming responses. You can now configure an endpoint to return realtime responses for Chat and Completions instead of waiting for the entire text contents to be completed. (2) Rate limits can now be set per endpoint in order to help control cost overrun when using SaaS models.

### Further Document Improvements

Continued the push for enhanced documentation, guides, tutorials, and examples by expanding on core MLflow functionality (Deployments, Signatures, and Model Dependency management), as well as entirely new pages for GenAI flavors. Check them out today!
