MLflow 2.8.0 includes several notable new features and improvements

- The MLflow Evaluate API has had extensive feature development in this release to support LLM workflows and multiple new evaluation modalities. See the new documentation, guides, and tutorials for MLflow LLM Evaluate to learn more.
- The MLflow Docs modernization effort has started. You will see a very different look and feel to the docs when visiting them, along with a batch of new tutorials and guides. More changes will be coming soon to the docs!
- 4 new LLM providers have been added! Google PaLM 2, AWS Bedrock, AI21 Labs, and HuggingFace TGI can now be configured and used within the AI Gateway. Learn more in the new AI Gateway docs!
