MLflow 2.9.2 is a patch release, containing several critical security fixes and configuration updates to support extremely large model artifacts.

Features:

- [Deployments] Add the `mlflow.deployments.openai` API to simplify direct access to OpenAI services through the deployments API ([#10473](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10473), [@prithvikannan](https://github.com/prithvikannan))
- [Server-infra] Add a new environment variable that permits disabling http redirects within the Tracking Server for enhanced security in publicly accessible tracking server deployments ([#10673](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10673), [@daniellok-db](https://github.com/daniellok-db))
- [Artifacts] Add environment variable configurations for both Multi-part upload and Multi-part download that permits modifying the per-chunk size to support extremely large model artifacts ([#10648](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10648), [@harupy](https://github.com/harupy))

Security fixes:

- [Server-infra] Disable the ability to inject malicious code via manipulated YAML files by forcing YAML rendering to be performed in a secure Sandboxed mode ([#10676](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10676), [@BenWilson2](https://github.com/BenWilson2), [#10640](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10640), [@harupy](https://github.com/harupy))
- [Artifacts] Prevent path traversal attacks when querying artifact URI locations by disallowing `..` path traversal queries ([#10653](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10653), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))
- [Data] Prevent a mechanism for conducting a malicious file traversal attack on Windows when using tracking APIs that interface with `HTTPDatasetSource` ([#10647](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10647), [@BenWilson2](https://github.com/BenWilson2))
- [Artifacts] Prevent a potential path traversal attack vector via encoded url traversal paths by decoding paths prior to evaluation ([#10650](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10650), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))
- [Artifacts] Prevent the ability to conduct path traversal attacks by enforcing the use of sanitized paths with the tracking server ([#10666](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10666), [@harupy](https://github.com/harupy))
- [Artifacts] Prevent path traversal attacks when using an FTP server as a backend store by enforcing base path declarations prior to accessing user-supplied paths ([#10657](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10657), [@harupy](https://github.com/harupy))

Documentation updates:

- [Docs] Add an end-to-end tutorial for RAG creation and evaluation ([#10661](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10661), [@AbeOmor](https://github.com/AbeOmor))
- [Docs] Add Tensorflow landing page ([#10646](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10646), [@chenmoneygithub](https://github.com/chenmoneygithub))
- [Deployments / Tracking] Add endpoints to LLM evaluation docs ([#10660](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10660), [@prithvikannan](https://github.com/prithvikannan))
- [Examples] Add retriever evaluation tutorial for LangChain and improve the Question Generation tutorial notebook ([#10419](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10419), [@liangz1](https://github.com/liangz1))
