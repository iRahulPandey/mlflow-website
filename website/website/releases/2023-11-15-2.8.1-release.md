MLflow 2.8.1 is a patch release, containing some critical bug fixes and an update to our continued work on reworking our docs.

Notable details:

- The API `mlflow.llm.log_predictions` is being marked as deprecated, as its functionality has been incorporated into `mlflow.log_table`. This API will be removed in the 2.9.0 release. ([#10414](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10414), [@dbczumar](https://github.com/dbczumar))
