We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.14.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.14.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.14.0 includes the following features and improvements:

- MLflow's model inference APIs (`mlflow.pyfunc.predict`), built-in model serving tools (`mlflow models serve`), and model signatures now support tensor inputs. In particular, MLflow now provides built-in support for scoring PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, ONNX, and Gluon models with tensor inputs. For more information, see https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#deploy-mlflow-models ([#3808](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3808), [#3894](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3894), [#4084](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4084), [#4068](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4068) [@wentinghu](https://github.com/wentinghu); [#4041](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4041) [@tomasatdatabricks](https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks), [#4099](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4099), [@arjundc-db](https://github.com/arjundc-db))
- Add new `mlflow.shap.log_explainer`, `mlflow.shap.load_explainer` APIs for logging and loading `shap.Explainer` instances ([#3989](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3989), [@vivekchettiar](https://github.com/vivekchettiar))
- The MLflow Python client is now available with a reduced dependency set via the `mlflow-skinny` PyPI package ([#4049](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4049), [@eedeleon](https://github.com/eedeleon))
- Add new `RequestHeaderProvider` plugin interface for passing custom request headers with REST API requests made by the MLflow Python client ([#4042](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4042), [@jimmyxu-db](https://github.com/jimmyxu-db))
- `mlflow.keras.log_model` now saves models in the TensorFlow SavedModel format by default instead of the older Keras H5 format ([#4043](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4043), [@harupy](https://github.com/harupy))
- `mlflow_log_model` now supports logging MLeap models in R ([#3819](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3819), [@yitao-li](https://github.com/yitao-li))
- Add `mlflow.pytorch.log_state_dict`, `mlflow.pytorch.load_state_dict` for logging and loading PyTorch state dicts ([#3705](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3705), [@shrinath-suresh](https://github.com/shrinath-suresh))
- `mlflow gc` can now garbage-collect artifacts stored in S3 ([#3958](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3958), [@sklingel](https://github.com/sklingel))
